-- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

#### Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is come up with a Model that will provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key demographic factors that might drive individuals’ financial outcomes.
#### Context
Currently, financial inclusion is a barrier to economic and human development in Africa. In Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda only 9.1 million adults (or 13.9% of the adult population) have access to or use a commercial bank account. Access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion.

#### Methods Used
1. Inferential Statistics
2. Univariate Analysis
3. Bivaraite Analysis
4. Multivariate analysis
5.  Data Visualization
6.  Predictive Modeling
etc.

####Technologies
**Python**
**Numpy arrays**
**Pandas, jupyter**
